			Quartz Moon Pies is the brainchild of Ben Green. Aside from a sweet-tooth, 
			Ben has always been creative at heart, as he was trained in fine arts. 
			For many years, Ben has dabbled in pie making. He's had a few successes and far, 
			far more failures, but throughout he's kept a passion for the goodness that only a perfect pie can impart.
			</p>
			<p>
			Beginning in 2015, Ben began to seriously cultivate his pie-making abilities. 
			He loves traditional fruit pies, cream pies, cobblers, crumbles, and everything in between. 
			He has a particular passion for different and offbeat recipes and flavor combinations, 
			always looking to discover a special meld of flavors that he can introduce to others. 
			He also shares a passion for health, and is always looking for ways to make his creations as 
			healthy as they can possibly be. Case by case, that may mean no sugar, no milk, no butter, 
			no egg, no flour, or any combination thereof. He never compromises on flavor, however. 
			Although the at-once perfectly healthy and perfectly tasty pie may not exist, Ben looks to 
			keep pushing the envelope ever more forward toward toward greater health while keeping it within 
			the boundaries of the irresistible.
